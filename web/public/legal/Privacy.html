  <h1>VAiyu Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="muted">Effective: 15 Oct 2025</div>

  <p>VAiyu (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) provides a hospitality operating system for hotels. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal information when customers use our products, websites, and related services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).</p>

  <h2>1) Scope</h2>
  <p>This Policy applies to personal information we process as a <em>controller</em> (e.g., website visitors, customer contacts). When we process guest data on behalf of a hotel, we act as a <em>processor</em>; such processing is governed by our Data Processing Addendum (“<strong>DPA</strong>”) with the hotel.</p>

  <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account and contact details (name, business email, role, phone).</li>
    <li>Authentication and usage data (login events, device, IP, pages and features used).</li>
    <li>Operational data provided by hotels (tickets, orders, rooms, service metadata), which may include guest identifiers controlled by the hotel.</li>
    <li>Support, survey, and communications content.</li>
    <li>Cookies and similar technologies for essential operation, analytics, and improving the experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, secure, and improve the Services.</li>
    <li>Authenticate users and maintain sessions.</li>
    <li>Provide support and communicate important updates.</li>
    <li>Analyze performance and product usage.</li>
    <li>Comply with law, enforce terms, and prevent abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Legal bases</h2>
  <p>Where applicable (e.g., GDPR/UK GDPR), our legal bases include contract performance, legitimate interests (product security, service analytics), consent (where required), and legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>5) Sharing</h2>
  <p>We share data with trusted service providers (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery, observability) under appropriate contracts. We may share information as required by law or in connection with corporate transactions. We do not sell personal data.</p>

  <h2>6) International transfers</h2>
  <p>We may transfer information to countries with different data protection laws. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>We implement technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk, including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, and audit logging. No method is 100% secure; customers should also implement best practices (e.g., SSO, MFA).</p>

  <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Hotels control retention of guest data processed under the DPA.</p>

  <h2>9) Your rights</h2>
  <p>Subject to applicable law, individuals may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of their personal data and to object or port their data. When we act as a processor, requests should be directed to the relevant hotel. You can also contact us and we will assist the controller.</p>

  <h2>10) Children</h2>
  <p>Our Services are intended for business use and not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect children’s personal data.</p>

  <h2>11) Contact</h2>
  <p>Questions or requests: <a href="mailto:privacy@vaiyu.app">privacy@vaiyu.app</a>. EU/UK representatives and additional details are available upon request.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the Services or by email.</p>
